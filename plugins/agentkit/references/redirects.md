# Redirects

Redirects are registered endpoints in Scalekit that control where users are directed during authentication flows. You must configure these endpoints in the Scalekit dashboard before they can be used.

All redirect URIs must be registered under Authentication settings in your Scalekit dashboard. This is a security requirement to prevent unauthorized redirects.


## Redirect endpoint types

### Allowed callback URLs
**Purpose**: Where users are sent after successful authentication to exchange authorization codes and retrieve profile information.

**Example scenario**: A user completes sign-in and Scalekit redirects them to `https://yourapp.com/callback` where your application processes the authentication response.

To add or remove an redirect URL, go to Dashboard > Authentication > Redirects > Allowed Callback URLs.

### Initiate login URL
**Purpose**: When authentication does not initiate from your application, Scalekit redirects users back to your application's login initiation endpoint. This endpoint should point to a route in your application that ultimately redirects users to Scalekit's `/authorize` endpoint.

**Example scenarios**:

- **Bookmarked login page**: A user bookmarks your login page and visits it directly. Your application detects they're not authenticated and redirects them to Scalekit's authorization endpoint.

- **Organization invitation flow**: A user clicks an invitation link to join an organization. Your application receives the invitation token and redirects the user to Scalekit's authorization endpoint to complete the sign-up process.

- **IdP-initiated SSO**: An administrator initiates single sign-on from their identity provider dashboard. The IdP redirects users to your application, which then redirects them to Scalekit's authorization endpoint to complete authentication.

- **Session expiration**: When a user's session expires or they access a protected resource, they're redirected to `https://yourapp.com/login` which then redirects to Scalekit's authentication endpoint.

### Post logout URL
**Purpose**: Where users are sent after successfully signing out of your application.

**Example scenario**: After logging out, users are redirected to `https://yourapp.com/goodbye` to confirm their session has ended.

### Back channel logout URL
**Purpose**: A secure endpoint that receives notifications whenever a user is logged out from Scalekit, regardless of how the logout was initiated — admin triggered, user initiated, or due to session policies like idle timeout.

**Example scenario**: When a user logs out from any application (user-initiated, admin-initiated, or due to session policies like idle timeout), Scalekit sends a logout notification to `https://yourapp.com/logout` to suggest termination of the user's session across all connected applications, ensuring coordinated logout for enhanced security.

### Custom URI schemes

Custom URI schemes allow for redirects, enabling deep linking and native app integrations. Some applications include:
- **Desktop applications**: Use schemes like `{scheme}://` for native app integration
- **Mobile apps**: Use schemes like `myapp://` for mobile app deep linking

**Example custom schemes**:
- `{scheme}://auth/callback` - For custom scheme authentication
- `myapp://login/callback` - For mobile app authentication


## URI validation requirements

Your redirect URIs must meet specific requirements that vary between development and production environments:

| Requirement | Development | Production |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Supported schemes | `http`, `https`, `{scheme}` | `https`, `{scheme}` |
| Localhost support | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Wildcard domains | Allowed | Not allowed |
| URI length limit | 256 characters | 256 characters |
| Query parameters | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| URL fragments | Not allowed | Not allowed |


### Wildcard usage patterns

Wildcards can simplify testing in development environments, but they must follow specific patterns:

| Validation rule | Valid examples | Invalid examples |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Wildcards cannot be used as root-level domains | `https://*.acmecorp.com`, `https://auth-*.acmecorp.com` | `https://*.com` |
| Only one wildcard character is allowed per URI | `https://*.acmecorp.com` | `https://*.*.acmecorp.com` |
| Wildcards must be in the hostname component only | `https://*.acmecorp.com` | `https://acmecorp.*.com` |
| Wildcards must be in the outermost subdomain | `https://*.auth.acmecorp.com` | `https://auth.*.acmecorp.com` |

> **Note**: According to the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2), redirect URIs must be absolute URIs. For development convenience, Scalekit relaxes this restriction slightly by allowing wildcards in development environments.
